If the path does not exist, it is created.\nbaudrate: the baudrate the device is configured to\nport: the serial port the device is connected to. If port is an empty string, the program will try to find the device automatically.\ninterval: the time between the individual measurements in seconds. It is implemented in such a way that the main measurement loop is idle for the interval time. This means that the individual measurements are more than interval seconds apart because additional time is spent reading the data from the device and writing to the file.\nlines_per_file=135_000: number of lines in a log file until a new file is created. 1MB roughly corresponds to 28,000 entries.\ndebug: prints messages that help to debug in case there are problems\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Index","page":"HTLogger Documentation","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"HTLogger Documentation","title":"HTLogger Documentation","text":"","category":"page"}]
